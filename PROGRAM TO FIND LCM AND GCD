2.PROGRAM TO FIND LCM AND GCD

def find_gcd(a,b):
    gcd = 1
    for i in range(1,a+1):
        if a%i==0 and b%i==0:
           gcd = i
    return gcd
first = int(input('Enter first number: '))
second = int(input('Enter second number: '))
print('HCF or GCD of %d and %d is %d' %(first, second, find_gcd(first, second)))
lcm = first * second / find_gcd(first, second)
print('LCM of %d and %d is %d' %(first, second, lcm))

OUTPUT:
Enter first number: 12
Enter second number: 8
HCF or GCD of 12 and 8 is 4
LCM of 12 and 8 is 24
